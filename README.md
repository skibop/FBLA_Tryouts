# FBLA_Tryouts

You are a freelance coder who has been approached by a local bookstore chain, Bibliophile Haven, to create a static landing page for their upcoming summer reading program. The details they provided are listed below. You need to present the coding details of the landing page to the bookstore owners (Ms. Markewitz and Mr. Maitland) within 1 minute. If your presentation exceeds 1 minute and 15 seconds, you will be cut short. Your presentation should focus on the technical aspects and features of the landing page, rather than the visual appeal, avoiding any website-building tools like Wix or Shopify. 
* The landing page must include a real-time countdown to the start of the summer reading program.
* The page should feature a registration form for participants to sign up for the program and the data should be stored somewhere.
